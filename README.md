# VIXEL

To be honest, I have no idea what this is supposed to be  ,( ; ~ ;),
This is an attempt at remaking an old project, titled Vector Pixels (vixel).
so, if you will, imagine a vectorized raster animation software-mostly made with games in mind.

## Usage
Require odin to be installed
current development version. odin-windows-amd64-dev-2025-04

Then simple run in the root of the project
```odin 
odin run .
```

template.vixel is an example of what the project contents will be like 


## Todo do
Menu for importing sprites
Ability to crop sprites
Ability to translate sprites in realtime
Timeline for animation
export sprites as spritesheet or singular animation
